## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is optimized for development in Firebase Studio. You can get started by simply asking the AI assistant to make changes or add new features.

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Installation

First, install the project dependencies using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Next, you'll need to set up your environment variables. Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project and add your OpenWeatherMap API key. You can get a free API key from the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/api).

```
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
*Note: The Genkit/Gemini API key is managed by Firebase Studio and does not need to be set locally for this project configuration.*

### 3. Running the Application

You can run the application in a few different ways:

- **Run the Next.js app and Genkit server together (recommended for development):**
  This command starts the Next.js development server and the Genkit development server concurrently.
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  The Next.js application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.
  The Genkit developer UI will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

- **Run only the Next.js development server:**
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
  The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

- **Run the Genkit server in watch mode:**
  This is useful if you are actively developing AI flows and want the server to restart on changes.
  ```bash
  npm run genkit:watch
  ```

### 4. Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will compile the Next.js application into an optimized set of static files and server-side code.
